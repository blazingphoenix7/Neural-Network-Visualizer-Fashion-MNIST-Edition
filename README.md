# Neural-Network-Visualizer-Fashion-MNIST-Edition


## Description
This project, "Neural Network Visualizer: Fashion MNIST Edition," was born out of curiosity to understand the intricacies of neural networks. By leveraging the Fashion MNIST dataset, a classic in the field of machine learning, this Python-based visualizer demystifies the layers, weights, and activations of neural networks. It provides an intuitive understanding of how data transforms through the network, making it an invaluable tool for both beginners trying to grasp the concepts of AI/ML and experienced developers seeking deeper insights into neural network behavior.


## Features
Layer Activations Visualization: See the transformation of input data through each layer of the network in real-time.
Weight Distributions Over Epochs: Observe how the weights of the network evolve during training, offering insights into the learning process.
Activation Functions Comparison: Understand the effects of different activation functions on the data passing through the network.
Network Architecture Comparisons: Easily compare the performance and behavior of various network architectures on the same dataset.


## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 3
Data Handling: NumPy for efficient array manipulations.
Visualization: Matplotlib for generating plots and visualizations of network behaviors.
Neural Network Framework: Custom-built, demonstrating the foundational aspects of neural network operations without high-level abstractions.
Dataset: Fashion MNIST, a standard dataset used in machine learning and deep learning for benchmarking algorithms.
